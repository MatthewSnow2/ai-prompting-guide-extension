npm run test:watch

# Format code before committing
npm run format

# Validate extension manually
npm run validate
```

### For Maintainers

```bash
# Create a release (automatically determined by commits)
git push origin main  # Triggers semantic-release

# Manual release with specific version
gh workflow run release.yml -f version=1.2.0

# Check security status
npm run security:scan
```

### For Contributors

1. Fork repository and create feature branch
2. Make changes following conventional commits
3. Pre-commit hooks ensure quality automatically
