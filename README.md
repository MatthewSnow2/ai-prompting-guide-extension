## 6. Framework for Adding / Editing Specialist Content

All domain knowledge lives in simple JSON files:

* **`data/specialists.json`**  
  ```json
  {
    "id": "marketing-content",
    "name": "Marketing & Content Specialist",
    "icon": "üì£",
    "welcomeMessage": "...",
    "placeholderText": "...",
    "defaultPromptingTechniques": [],
    "commonPatterns": [],
    "pitfallAvoidance": [],
    "outputOptimization": []
  }
  ```

* **`data/models.json`** ‚Äî same idea for model categories.

To add content:

1. Duplicate an existing object, change `id`, `name`, and texts.  
2. Save ‚Äì the extension hot-loads the new data on next refresh (or use the _Reload_ button in chrome://extensions).  

_No build step required._
