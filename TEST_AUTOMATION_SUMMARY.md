- **Lines of Test Code**: ~4,500 lines
- **Coverage Target**: 80% minimum (85% for critical components)
- **Security Tests**: 50+ XSS and injection attack scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Memory, DOM, and execution time validation

## 🧪 Test Framework Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Jest Test Framework** - Modern JavaScript testing with Chrome extension support
2. **Chrome API Mocking** - Complete Chrome extension API simulation  
3. **Puppeteer E2E Testing** - Real browser automation for extension workflows
4. **Security Testing Suite** - XSS prevention and input sanitization validation
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Memory usage and DOM operation efficiency testing

### Attack Vector Testing
- ✅ 6+ XSS payload variations
- ✅ SQL injection patterns
- ✅ Path traversal attempts
- ✅ Buffer overflow scenarios
- ✅ Encoded attack vectors

## ⚡ Performance Testing Coverage

### Memory Management
- ✅ Memory leak detection and prevention
- ✅ Resource cleanup validation
- ✅ Memory pressure handling
- ✅ Garbage collection monitoring
- ✅ Large dataset handling (50MB limit)

### DOM Performance  
- ✅ Element creation efficiency (100 elements <100ms)
- ✅ DOM node limits (1000 node maximum)
- ✅ Batch operation optimization
- ✅ Event listener management (100 listener limit)
- ✅ Rapid UI update handling

### Background Script Performance
- ✅ Message processing throughput (100 messages <5s)
- ✅ Service worker responsiveness
- ✅ Storage operation efficiency
- ✅ Concurrent operation handling

## 🔧 Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration
- **Test Environment**: jsdom for DOM simulation
- **Coverage Thresholds**: 80% global, 85% critical components
- **Test Timeout**: 30s default, 60s for E2E tests
- **Reporters**: Text, HTML, LCOV, JSON formats

### Quality Gates
1. **Linting**: ESLint with security rules
2. **Unit Tests**: 80%+ coverage requirement  
3. **Security Tests**: All XSS prevention tests must pass
4. **Performance Tests**: Must meet memory and timing thresholds
5. **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflow validation
