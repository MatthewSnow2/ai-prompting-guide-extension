# AI Prompting Guide – Project Summary  
*(File: `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` — updated 2025-07-21)*  

## 1. Overview
AI Prompting Guide is a Chrome extension (Manifest V3) that embeds a specialist-driven, model-aware prompting assistant on any web page.  
The goal is to streamline user workflows with LLMs by supplying tailored prompt advice, custom rules, and personal notes – all stored locally.

## 2. What’s Been Accomplished
✔ Complete **extension scaffold** with manifest, icons, folder structure  
✔ **Draggable / resizable chat-style UI** injected via content script  
✔ **Popup window** for quick actions & settings  
✔ **10 predefined specialists** and **6 model categories** loaded from JSON  
✔ **Background service-worker** for data, storage, commands  
✔ **Local persistence** of size, position, specialist, model, notes & rules  
✔ **Keyboard shortcuts** (`Alt+P`, `Ctrl+Shift+P`)  
✔ **Placeholder advisory engine** (merges rules + sample guidance)  
✔ Full **PNG/SVG icon set** & generator scripts  
✔ **Documentation**: README, Installation-Testing, Development Guide  

All code is committed and the working tree is clean (`git log` shows 3 structured commits).

Legend: **Done** = fully implemented & tested locally • In-Progress = partial UI or logic • Stub = skeleton code • Planned = not started

## 4. Technical Implementation Status
1. **Manifest V3**  
   • Permissions: `storage`, `activeTab`, `<all_urls>`  
   • Commands mapped for shortcuts  

2. **Background Service-Worker**  
   • Loads specialists & models from bundled JSON or storage cache  
   • Handles messaging, storage CRUD, keyboard commands  
   • Generates placeholder advice via `generatePlaceholderResponse()`  

3. **Content Script (UI)**  
   • Pure vanilla JS & CSS, no frameworks  
   • Injects one container per tab; safe against duplicate injection  
   • Drag, resize & keyboard handlers persist state  
   • Sends/receives messages to/from background  

4. **Popup**  
   • Lightweight HTML/CSS/JS  
   • Can toggle interface, change specialist, tweak basic settings  

5. **Assets & Tooling**  
   • Python + HTML utilities to generate icons  
   • No build step required; code runs unpacked in Chrome  

## 5. Ready for Manual Testing
Refer to `INSTALLATION_TESTING.md` for a full checklist. Core flows that should now work:  
• Install unpacked → popup opens without errors  
• Toggle chat window, drag & resize, refresh page – position persists  
• Select specialists & models – welcome message / placeholder text updates  
• Send a chat message – placeholder advice returns referencing both selections  
• Keyboard shortcuts work across tabs  

## 6. Known Gaps & Next Development Steps
1. **Settings Panel**  
   - Build full UI for rules editor, notes editor, import/export.  
2. **Rules Engine Logic**  
   - Enforce formatting/tone constraints on generated advice.  
3. **Notes Feature**  
   - UI fields + storage integration.  
4. **Real Intelligent Suggestion System**  
   - Integrate with chosen LLM API; replace placeholder responses.  
5. **Context Awareness**  
   - Detect common AI sites and auto-open (if user enables).  
6. **Options / Advanced Pages**  
   - Dedicated options.html for deep settings.  
7. **Accessibility & Dark Mode**  
   - Audit for ARIA labels, high-contrast theme toggle.  
8. **Automated Testing**  
   - Add Jest + Puppeteer smoke tests.  
9. **Store Prep**  
   - Privacy policy, minification, release pipeline.

## 7. Next Sprint Goals (Suggested)
1. Finish **Settings panel** with rules + notes CRUD (High priority).  
2. Implement **per-specialist notes** UI & storage (High).  
3. Wire **global vs specialist rules** enforcement to placeholder generator (Medium).  
4. Add **import/export JSON** (Medium).  
5. Begin **LLM API integration** proof-of-concept for one specialist (Research).

**Project is installable and functional as an MVP.**  
Further work will focus on deepening intelligence, polishing UX, and preparing for Chrome Web Store submission.
